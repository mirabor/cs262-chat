2-3-2025, evening: set up project structure

2-3-2025, late night:

json_protocol/server.py
- chose threading for concurrency. each client connection gets a separate thread to prevent blocking while allowing the server to handle multiple requests.
- read length of incoming JSON, read data, process, send back response
- using threading.Lock for thread-safety to prevent race conditions when creating accounts
- TODO: extend the _process method for other operations besides creating an account

json_protocol/client.py
- chose tkinter after researching common Python GUIs
- set up json client methods init and send request so that we stick with one request-response cycle at a time
- TODO: build UI (haven't used tkinter before, we'll see)

setup.py
- set up setup for installation

tests/test_json.py
- started writing some tests for creating an account, more operations to follow

2-7-2025, afternoon:

tkinter â€” assume that people will have a Mac to use our project (lol)

json protocol: each request from the client is a json obj with an "operation" field for the action and other relevant fields; the server processes this, does the action, and sends back a JSON response with a "status" and "message"

#5 seems like a specification on the frontend side, 5 at a time on frontend instead of all at once using a queue, the server actually has all the messages, but the UI can show limited messages
