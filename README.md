# CS262 Chat Application

Welcome to our chat app, a PyQt6-based client with a dark theme UI and a Python server for real-time messaging!

Our application is built with a client-server architecture, supporting multiple clients connecting to the server from different machines. We have implemented two **wire protocols**: JSON and our custom protocol (SAMIRAðŸ”¥).

## Features

Our application implements the below functional requirements:

âœ… **Account Management**

- Create account with unique username, nickname, and password
- Log in with existing account
- Delete account
- List/search accounts with wildcard support

âœ… **Messaging**

- Real-time message delivery
- Offline message storage
- Configurable unread message to be delivered at any time
- Message status tracking (number of unread messages)
- Individual and bulk message deletion

âœ… **Multi-Machine Support**

- Tested server-client communication on different machines
- Server accessible from any client on the network
- Tested with two **wire protocols**: JSON and our custom protocol (SAMIRAðŸ”¥)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)
- make (build tool)

### Quick Start

1. Clone and install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cs262-chat.git
cd cs262-chat
make install && make install-dev
```

2. Start server:

```bash
make run-server
```

3. Start client

   1. On the same machine as server (new terminal):

      ```bash
      make run-client-gui
      ```

   2. Connecting from a different machine (replace `SERVER_IP` with server's IP):

      ```bash
      make run-client-gui CLIENT_ID=YOUR_DESIRED_ID SERVER_IP=SERVER_IP
      ```

> [!NOTE]
> > `SERVER_IP` will be displayed on the machine where the server is running with other server details (e.g. what wire protocol is being used, port, etc.).
> `YOUR_DESIRED_ID` can be any string you want to use as your client ID.
